## Checklist

- [ ] `npm run typecheck` passes (strict TypeScript, frontend and backend)

- [ ] `npm run check:clean` passes (no keys, no private files, no brand assets)
- [ ] `npm run build` passes
- [ ] Interface changes follow the design rules in AGENTS.md: light paper and dark carbon themes, quiet `.frame` and `.well` surfaces, app accents only on app marks (`#335CFF`, `#3B82F6`, `#10B981`, `#F97316`, `#14B8A6`), DM Mono for labels, touch targets of 44 px on iPad
- [ ] Interface text is English; new strings that the IDE shows have a German entry in `src/app/i18n-de.ts`
- [ ] Docs updated where behavior changed (README, AGENTS.md, the guides in `docs/`, `src/docs/content.md`)
- [ ] I agree that my contribution is licensed under MIT OR Apache-2.0 (open-source parts)
