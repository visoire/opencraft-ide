# MCP tools

The OpenCraft chat works on your files through MCP tools. The same tools are available to any other
MCP client, such as Claude Desktop or Claude Code, while the IDE runs.

Every tool is defined once, as a Zod schema in `TOOL_DEFS` in [`src/mcp/schemas.ts`](../src/mcp/schemas.ts).
That one definition feeds the backend MCP server, the browser orchestrator, the `/` commands in the
chat and the tool definitions sent to the models.

## The tools

All paths are project paths such as `/sheets/finances.xlsx`.

### GridCraft

| Tool | Arguments | Does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `read-sheet` | `path`, `sheet?`, `range?` (for example `A1:D20`) | reads calculated values as rows; formulas and dynamic arrays are evaluated |
| `write-sheet` | `path`, `sheet?`, `cells` (map such as `{"B1": "=SUM(B2:B9)"}`), `mode` (`merge` or `replace`) | writes values or formulas, creates the file if needed |

### WordCraft

| Tool | Arguments | Does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `read-document` | `path` | reads `.docx`, `.md`, `.txt` or the text of `.odt` as Markdown |
| `write-document` | `path`, `markdown`, `mode` (`replace` or `append`), `title?` | writes Markdown as `.docx` or `.md` (headings, lists, tables, bold, italic) |

### DeckCraft

| Tool | Arguments | Does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `read-slides` | `path` | reads the texts of all slides of a `.pptx` |
| `create-slide` | `path`, `title?`, `slides` (1 to 30, each with `title`, `bullets`, `notes?`), `mode` (`append` or `replace`) | creates slides in a `.pptx` |

### PdfCraft

| Tool | Arguments | Does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `read-pdf` | `path`, `pages?` (for example `1-3,5`) | reads the text of a PDF |
| `sign-pdf` | `path`, `name`, `page?`, `position` (`unten-rechts`, `unten-links`, `oben-rechts`), `output?` | places a visible signature block and saves a signed copy. **Needs approval.** |
| `images-to-pdf` | `images` (1 to 60 paths), `output`, `title?` | combines images and scans into one PDF, one image per page |

`sign-pdf` adds a visible signature block (name, date, line), not a cryptographic signature.

### Project and code

| Tool | Arguments | Does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `list-files` | `dir` | lists files and folders |
| `search-files` | `query`, `dir` | searches text in text and code files |
| `read-file` | `path` | reads a text or code file |
| `write-file` | `path`, `content` | writes a text or code file and creates folders |
| `search-project` | `query`, `mode` (`hybrid`, `text`, `semantic`), `limit` | full-text and semantic search across documents, sheets, slides, PDFs, code and chats |
| `remember` | `note` | keeps a note in the project memory |
| `file-history` | `path` | versions of a file and which tool step wrote it from which inputs |

### Terminal, Git and panels

| Tool | Arguments | Does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `run-command` | `command`, `cwd` | runs a shell command in the project folder (60 s limit). **Needs approval.** |
| `git-status` | none | changed and new files |
| `git-commit` | `message`, `all` | stages changes and commits |
| `git-log` | `limit` | the latest commits |
| `open-panel` | `app`, `path?` | opens a panel and optionally a file in it (runs in the browser) |
| `panel-status` | `app` | open file, loaded, minimized, unsaved changes (runs in the browser) |

Plugins add their own tools with the prefix `ext-<server>-`.

## Using the tools in the chat

- Type `/` to list every tool and command. A tool picked with `/` is forced for that message.
- With complete arguments, a tool runs directly without a model:
  `/read-sheet @finances.xlsx range=A1:E6`.
- Type `@` to attach files, folders or panels. Mentioning an app, such as `@gridcraft`, points the
  model at that app's tools.

What happens with each call:

1. **Repair.** Tool JSON with Markdown fences, single quotes, trailing commas or a cut-off end goes
   through a repair pass first (`src/core/json-repair.ts`).
2. **Validate.** The arguments are checked against the Zod schema. Invalid arguments go back to the
   model once as a structured error, without running anything ("self-correction").
3. **Approve.** `run-command`, `sign-pdf` and tools of external servers that need it wait for your
   confirmation. The backend checks a single-use token, so no client can skip the dialog.
4. **Run.** Reads run in parallel. Writes to the same file wait in line (`src/mcp/locks.ts`).
5. **Show.** The tool card in the chat shows the arguments, the duration and a preview of the result.
   Panels showing the changed file reload it in place.

If a step still fails, the chain pauses with **Retry**, **Edit**, **Report the error to the AI** and
**Cancel**.

## Using the tools from another MCP client

While the IDE runs, it serves every tool at `http://localhost:5175/mcp` over Streamable HTTP.

```sh
claude mcp add --transport http opencraft http://localhost:5175/mcp
```

Requests from the same computer need nothing else. Requests from another device on your network need
the access token (the `x-oc-token` header), like the REST API. Approval tools still ask for
confirmation in the IDE.

The apps also ship their own command-line tools with MCP servers, independent of OpenCraft:

```sh
claude mcp add wordcraft -- wordcraft-cli mcp
claude mcp add gridcraft -- gridcraft-cli mcp
```

## Adding a tool

1. Add one `def({...})` entry to `TOOL_DEFS` in `src/mcp/schemas.ts`:
   - `name`: kebab-case, verb first (`read-sheet`);
   - `title` and an English `description`;
   - `app` and `side` (`server` or `client`);
   - a Zod `input` object;
   - `pathArg` for the file it edits, `writes: true` if panels should refresh, `approval: true` if it
     changes things outside the project.
2. **Append it. Never reorder existing tools:** the tool list goes to the models in a fixed order so
   the provider's prompt cache keeps hitting.
3. Implement it in `src/server/tools.ts` (server side) or the panel server (client side).
4. Add a test in `tests/server/` and a line to `src/docs/content.md` and to this file.

Provider differences are handled for you: `compileToolSchema` produces strict JSON Schema for OpenAI
and Claude and `functionDeclarations` for Gemini, and `normalizeToolArgs` maps the arguments back
before validation.
